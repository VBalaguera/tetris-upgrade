# Тетрис APP

## an unapologetic Tetris project made out of love, and with React

```sh
npm install && cd tetris && npm run start
```

This project was inspired by this [original tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).

The objective was to implement upon the original project as many useful functions as possible. Some of them are pretty obvious (like the amount of new difficulty levels or how depending on which one you're playing the score ), from subtle necessitites like recreating absent tetrominoes.

Tetrominoes:

- O: https://svgur.com/s/dhL
- Z: https://svgur.com/s/dgi
- T: https://svgur.com/i/dha.svg
- S: https://svgur.com/s/di8
- L v1: https://svgur.com/s/di9
- J: https://svgur.com/s/dgo
- I: https://svgur.com/s/dhb

All tetrominoes created with Adobe Illustrator. And their movements were inspired by the [1989 Game Boy version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNbo1AGqKrI&ab_channel=WorldofLongplays).
