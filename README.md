# Тетрис APP
## an unapologetic Tetris project made out of love, and with React

This project was jumpstarted with this [original tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).

The objective was to implement as many useful functions as possible. Some of them are pretty obvious (like the amount of new difficulty levels), from subtle necessitites like recreating absent tetrominoes. 

tetrominoes:
O: https://svgur.com/s/dhL 
Z: https://svgur.com/s/dgi 
T: https://svgur.com/i/dha.svg
S: https://svgur.com/s/di8 
L v1: https://svgur.com/s/di9
J: https://svgur.com/s/dgo
I: https://svgur.com/s/dhb 

All tetrominoes created with Adobe Illustrator.
